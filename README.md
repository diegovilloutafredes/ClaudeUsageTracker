# ClaudeTracker

A macOS menu bar app that shows your [Claude AI](https://claude.ai) usage limits in real time — utilization percentages, progress bars, and countdown timers until each window resets.

## Features

- Live 5-Hour and 7-Day utilization bars with color-coded thresholds (green / orange / red)
- **7-Day Sonnet** sub-window bar (toggleable in Settings) for Max users tracking Sonnet-specific consumption
- **Multi-account** — sign in to multiple Claude accounts and switch between them from the popover header; each account is isolated in its own browser session (no cookie collisions); per-account chart history and pace state
- Reset countdowns with relative time display ("resets in 3 hours")
- Menu bar icon showing the selected window's utilization percentage; icon and badge use a continuous green → yellow → orange → red urgency gradient
- Subscription badge (Pro, Max 5x, Max 20x, Team, Enterprise)
- **Charts tab** — historical area + line charts for all four windows with selectable time ranges (1h / 5h / 24h / 7d / 30d) and hover-interactive crosshair
- **Pace indicator** — shows current consumption rate (%/hr) and projected time to full; configurable rate window (30s / 1m / 5m / 10m / 15m / 30m)
- **Pace alerts** — toast/sound notification when a window is projected to fill before it resets; auto-dismissed when pace improves past the warning threshold
- **Stale data detection** — if a usage window reset while the Mac was asleep, the app detects it on wake and refreshes instead of showing stale high utilization
- Configurable notifications when a window resets: toast near the menu bar, sound, and system banner
  - Toast duration slider (1-30 s) or permanent mode until dismissed
- **Auto-update** — periodically checks GitHub Releases on an adaptive schedule (based on historical release cadence), checks again on wake from sleep, and auto-installs with a countdown if enabled; shows a banner in the popover and a toast when a new version is found
- **Popup scale** — slider (75–150%) to resize the popover proportionally
- **Diagnostic logs** — rolling file log at `~/Library/Logs/ClaudeTracker/`; open directly from Settings
- Configurable refresh interval (1-60 seconds, default 5 s)
- No API key required — uses your existing claude.ai browser session

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Xcode 15 or later (build from source only)
- An active [Claude](https://claude.ai) account (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)

## Installation

### Download a release

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/diegovilloutafredes/ClaudeTracker/releases) and download the latest version. Two formats are provided:

**DMG (recommended)**
1. Open `ClaudeTracker.dmg`
2. Drag `ClaudeTracker.app` to the `/Applications` shortcut in the window
3. Launch from Applications

**ZIP (fallback)**
1. Download `ClaudeTracker.zip` and unzip it
2. Double-click `install.command` — it copies the app to `/Applications`, strips the Gatekeeper quarantine flag, and launches it

> Because the app is not yet signed with a Developer ID certificate, macOS may block the first launch. If that happens, right-click the app and choose **Open**, or run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ClaudeTracker.app`.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegovilloutafredes/ClaudeTracker.git
cd ClaudeTracker
make run
```

This builds, installs to `/Applications/`, and launches the app in one step.

To package distributable artifacts (DMG + ZIP):

```bash
make release
# Outputs: release/ClaudeTracker.dmg and release/ClaudeTracker.zip
```

To sign and notarize (requires Apple Developer ID credentials):

```bash
make release \
  SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
  APPLE_ID=you@example.com \
  APPLE_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx \
  APPLE_TEAM_ID=TEAMID
```

### First launch

1. Click the menu bar icon (shows a percentage, or `--` when not signed in)
2. Click **Add a Claude account** — a browser window opens with claude.ai
3. Sign in normally; the app detects the session cookie automatically
4. The window closes and usage data loads within a few seconds

To add a second account, open the popover and click the chevron next to the header → **Add account**. Switching between accounts pivots the menu bar label, popover content, and charts to the selected account; each account's polling, pace history, and reset notifications are tracked independently.

## How it works

Claude.ai uses Cloudflare bot-detection that blocks plain `URLSession` requests. The app loads `claude.ai` in a hidden `WKWebView` and issues all API calls via `callAsyncJavaScript`. Requests originate from a real browser context with the correct cookies, headers, and TLS fingerprint — the same way the web app works.

Each Claude account gets its own `WKWebsiteDataStore(forIdentifier:)`, so cookies (including `sessionKey`) are fully isolated per account. Adding a second account does not log out the first. Sign-in persists across relaunches per account.

## Architecture

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ClaudeTrackerApp.swift` | App entry point, `MenuBarExtra` scene, composed menu bar image |
| `ClaudeAPIService.swift` | Hidden `WKWebView` for API calls (per-account `WKWebsiteDataStore(forIdentifier:)`); login page loading and cookie polling |
| `UsageViewModel.swift` | Published state, polling timer, per-account state buckets, UserDefaults persistence, notification dispatch, auto-update, stale data detection, account add/switch/remove lifecycle |
| `Models.swift` | Codable structs for API responses; `Account` + `AccountStore` + per-account `AccountState`; `MenuBarWindow` display enum; `UpdateInfo`; `computePace()` |
| `LoginView.swift` | `NSViewRepresentable` wrapping the API web view; `LoginWindowController` |
| `ToastWindowController.swift` | Floating `NSPanel`-based toast, positioned near the top-right corner |
| `MenuBarView.swift` | Popover content — scalable progress bars (incl. Sonnet sub-window), reset countdowns, charts tab, update banner, account picker |
| `SettingsView.swift` | Accounts list (rename / switch / remove), update checker, popup scale, notification and refresh settings |
| `AppLogger.swift` | Rolling file logger (`~/Library/Logs/ClaudeTracker/`); also writes to `os.log` |
